GGreg20_V3 Ionizing Radiation Detector for Arduino UNO WOKWI simulator

IoT-devices GGreg20_V3 with Display SSD1306 Demo sketch

Filename: IoT-devices-GGreg20_V3_DisplaySSD1306-Demo-sketch.ino

This is a demonstration sketch that clearly shows how the GGreg20_V3 radiation detector connects and works with the Arduino UNO controller. 

This example shows a valid code that can be used with a real controller and module GGreg20_V3 manufactured by IoT-devices LLC.

In addition to the Arduino controllers, the GGreg20_V3 can work with any other controller that can handle GPIO events, or even those that can measure 
logic through an ADC (if needed). 

For example, such controllers are ESP32, ESP8266, STM32, Raspberry Pi and many others.

The circuit (simulated):
- GGreg20_V3 Ionizing Radiation Detector's pulse output is emulated via simple pushbutton
- Arduino UNO
- OLED Display SSD1306, I2C
- LED blinks with pulses
